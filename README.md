# A broken doorknob - A refugee's monologue

Hi! Welcome to my data visualization project on refugee issue. For this project, I created an interactive storytelling experience together with a poem I wrote to depict the data from a refugee's perspective. The datasets were synthesized from a variety of sources, including https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/,https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SM.POP.REFG, etc. The countries of which data is shown are Afghanistan, South Sudan, Ukraine, and Venezuela.
